                  Are you a current Georgia Tech student? You can still participate 
                  in this event! Each year GT students volunteer as mentors to help 
                  facilitate the projects and activities included in each track. This 
                  is an opportunity for you to directly interact with high school students 
                  from the Metro Atlanta area and share your passion and knowledge for computer 
                  science and engineering. Responsibilities of mentors include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Co-leading a student cohort of up to 12 students

                  Throughout the day, students will follow one of four tracks:
                  Robotics, Gaming, Information Security, or MusicTech.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each track will have workshops and will allow students to
                  build a piece of technology they can take home. In addition to
                  the track workshops, there will be opportunities for students
                  to engage with industry professionals and college students.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We want to show high school students the value of computer science, 
                  which is why we are providing all of the resources you'll need to get started!

                      circuits through the interactions of the Arduino and the
                      breadboard. Throughout the day, you will have lessons
                      about the basics of electronics, slowly building on top of
                      each other, and finishing the day by constructing your own
                      robot. You will create and control your own devices and
                      gain skills just enough to make you slightly dangerous. If
                      you have a spark in interest, come join robotics!

                      video games are a popular and interactive way to code and
                      launch experiences! The Gaming track focuses on teaching
                      fundamental computing concepts by introducing game design
                      with levels, animations, and characters using block-based
                      coding. In this programming adventure, participants will
                      level up by completing short challenges and activities to
                      reinforce concepts learned and will finish the day with a

                      The music technology track focuses on the intersection
                      between music and programming! This track will teach you
                      how to code in either Python or Javascript to compose
                      individual beats and ultimately, a song, through a program
                      called EarSketch. Musicians aren't the only ones that can
                      make catchy tunes. After going through this track, you,
                      too, will be equipped with computer science skills to
                      produce sick beats!
