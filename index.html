              <p>Are parents allowed to come?</p>
              <p>
                Although we are grateful for parental support, this is a
                student-only event from check-in on.

              <p>How do I choose which track to attend?</p>
              <p>
                Participants will be able to choose which track they would like
                to attend during registration.

              <p>What is HackGT?</p>
              <p>
                HackGT is a student organization and 501(c)(3) non-profit at
                Georgia Tech devoted to Computer Science outreach in collegiate
                and high school communities. To learn more, check out our
                organization website <a href="https://hack.gt">here</a>.
              </p>
              <p>What is the A/B schedule? Which one should I pick?</p>
              <p>
                To accomodate as many students as possible, we have split the
                schedule into two sections, A and B. The A schedule runs from
                9am - 7pm and the B schedule runs from 10am - 8pm. Both schedules 
                will get the same instructions; they differ only in the start and 
                end times as well as the timing for a presentation. Whichever schedule
                you choose has no effect on the content you learn, so pick the one that
                is most convenient for you! Please note that students being picked-up
                or dropped-off together should register for the same session.
